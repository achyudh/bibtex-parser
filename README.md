# BibTeX Parser
A Python script for parsing BibTeX bibliographic databases using PLY (Python Lex-Yacc)

This script is built on top of PLY (Python Lex-Yacc). I would recommend getting PLY from PyPI using the instructions [here.](https://bibtexparser.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.2/install.html#requirements)
